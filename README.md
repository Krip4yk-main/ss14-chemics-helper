Export .yml file from [here](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/tree/a367097c33591f461aa875461054a9a596ccee3f/Resources/Prototypes/Recipes/Reactions) 
to any .txt file for both Medical and Chemistry and overwrite related .ts in save path.

It should work with any recipes like that but need enhancement of UI to display it
(or you can just use meds.ts and chems.ts by just increasing array)

To run dev:

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

To build project
```bash
npm i
npm run electron:build
```
